==========
A sandbox for bookclub problems. Starting with a wrapper on top of [lololodash](https://github.com/mdunisch/lololodash/)

## Getting Started ##

First, install [node](http://nodejs.org)

The nodejs installation will also install npm, the Node Package Manager.

Then, install package dependencies

> npm install

## Week 1 ## 
Getting started with lodash. 
We will use lololodash (fun command line powered Lodash exercises) to get us familiar with lodash.

1. Run lololodash
   ```./foo```
2. Work through each exercise, code up your solution in the corresponding js file. Your solution to part 1 goes in 1.js.
3. Verify your solution works
   ```
   // verify part 1
  ./foo verify 1.js
  ```
